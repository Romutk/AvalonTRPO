- 
-   * Moved to a git repository.
-   * vidir: Applied patch from Stefan Fritsch (one part of #412176):
-     - Check for control characters (especially newlines) in filenames
-       and error out, since this can greatly confuse the editor or vidir.
-     - If the source of a rename does not exist (and thus the rename will fail
-       anyway), vidir should not move an existing target file to a tmpfile.
-     - If a directory is renamed, vidir should take that into account when
-       renaming files in this directory.
-     - If a directory name is passed as name/ to vidir, vidir should not
-       add second slash after the name.
-   * vidir: Add support for unlinking directories. To recursivly delete
-     a directory and its contents, pipe find to vidir, and delete the directory
-     and its contents in the editor. Closes: #412176
-   * Add example to man page about recursive modification of directories.

-   * Remove notes about potential tools from README, moved to wiki.
-   * vidir: Don't abort if it sees an empty or all-whitespace line.
-   * vidir: If just a filename is removed and the number is left,
-     treat this the same as removing the whole line, and delete the file,
-     instead of trying to rename the file to "".
-   * vidir: Remove the periods after the item numbers.
-   * vidir: Man page improvements. Closes: #378122
-   * combine: Man page improvements, to clarify even more that order does
-     matter and that the operations are not commutative. Closes: #361123
-   * combine: The behavior of "or" was fairly strange if lines were repeated in
-     a file. Changed behavior to just print all lines from both files, even
-     if this means printing dups. Not sure I like this behavior either, but
-     it's consistent with the very useful behaviors of "and" and "not".
-   * vidir, vipe: Use /usr/bin/editor if it's present, and EDITOR and VISUAL
-     arn't set, to comply with Debian policy. For portability, fall back to vi

- Description: additional Unix utilities
-  This is a growing collection of the Unix tools that nobody thought
-  to write long ago, when Unix was young.
-  .
-  So far, it includes the following utilities:
-   - chronic: runs a command quietly unless it fails
-   - combine: combine the lines in two files using boolean operations
-   - errno: look up errno names and descriptions
-   - ifdata: get network interface info without parsing ifconfig output
-   - ifne: run a program if the standard input is not empty
-   - isutf8: check if a file or standard input is utf-8
-   - lckdo: execute a program with a lock held
-   - mispipe: pipe two commands, returning the exit status of the first
-   - parallel: run multiple jobs at once
-   - pee: tee standard input to pipes
-   - sponge: soak up standard input and write to a file
-   - ts: timestamp standard input
-   - vidir: edit a directory in your text editor
-   - vipe: insert a text editor into a pipe
-   - zrun: automatically uncompress arguments to command

- <<\DOC_END
- 
- This sample hook safeguards topic branches that have been
- published from being rewound.
- 
- The workflow assumed here is:
- 
-  * Once a topic branch forks from "master", "master" is never
-    merged into it again (either directly or indirectly).
- 
-  * Once a topic branch is fully cooked and merged into "master",
-    it is deleted.  If you need to build on top of it to correct
-    earlier mistakes, a new topic branch is created by forking at
-    the tip of the "master".  This is not strictly necessary, but
-    it makes it easier to keep your history simple.
- 
-  * Whenever you need to test or publish your changes to topic
-    branches, merge them into "next" branch.
- 
- The script, being an example, hardcodes the publish branch name
- to be "next", but it is trivial to make it configurable via
- $GIT_DIR/config mechanism.
- 
- With this workflow, you would want to know:
- 
- (1) ... if a topic branch has ever been merged to "next".  Young
-     topic branches can have stupid mistakes you would rather
-     clean up before publishing, and things that have not been
-     merged into other branches can be easily rebased without
-     affecting other people.  But once it is published, you would
-     not want to rewind it.
- 
- (2) ... if a topic branch has been fully merged to "master".
-     Then you can delete it.  More importantly, you should not
-     build on top of it -- other people may already want to
-     change things related to the topic as patches against your
-     "master", so if you need further changes, it is better to
-     fork the topic (perhaps with the same name) afresh from the
-     tip of "master".
- 
- Let's look at this example:
- 
- 		   o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o "next"
- 		  /       /           /           /
- 		 /   a---a---b A     /           /
- 		/   /               /           /
- 	       /   /   c---c---c---c B         /

- A, B and C are topic branches.
- 
-  * A has one fix since it was merged up to "next".
- 
-  * B has finished.  It has been fully merged up to "master" and "next",
-    and is ready to be deleted.
- 
-  * C has not merged to "next" at all.
- 
- We would want to allow C to be rebased, refuse A, and encourage
- B to be deleted.
- 
- To compute (1):
- 
- 	git rev-list ^master ^topic next
- 	git rev-list ^master        next
- 
- 	if these match, topic has not merged in next at all.
- 
- To compute (2):
- 
- 	git rev-list master..topic
- 
- 	if this is empty, it is fully merged to "master".
